<h2>The first step to a better you</h2>
<p>
Hello and Welcome! I am a Licensed Marriage and Family Therapist. I recognize that beginning therapy, especially for the first time, can feel uncomfortable or scary, but it doesnâ€™t have to be. Upon our first interaction, my goal is to make you feel comfortable and provide you with as much information and knowledge about the process as you need. It is important for me that you find a therapist that seems like a good fit for you and that you and I can create a space that will be insightful and beneficial for you. 
</p>
<p>
I specialize in romantic relationships and the anxieties that individuals encounter throughout their dating lives. Previously, I have worked in matchmaking, dating coaching, and dating apps, which I believe have given me a better perspective on what the average dating male or female encounter on a regular basis. In addition to this, I have worked at the campus assault resource and education center at the University of California, Irvine and completed a traineeship at West Los Angeles Community College. I currently work in private practice and a residential treatment center for teenagers. Throughout my professional career, I have been fortunate enough to work with individuals, couples, and groups from all different backgrounds and with various diagnoses or concerns. 
</p>
<p>
I have a sincere interest in what brings you to therapy now and the subtleties that have brought us together. Your past and your perspective world help me to understand you better in the context of the various systems you are a part of. We are individuals part of societal groups, work groups, familial groups, romantic groups, cultural groups, etc. and each of those may play a significant role in the way we work together to move forward.
</p>
<h2>The Unique Therapeutic Experience</h2>

<blockquote>Therapy is uniquely different to the relationships we maintain in our daily lives and I believe that is why it leaves such a lasting impact. In a therapeutic relationship, the focus is on you and only you. There are no opinions or judgment in the room and that is so you, the client, can hopefully feel comfortable enough fully embrace each part of yourself. There are no rights or wrongs or should's or shouldn'ts in therapy. There is only a space for you to speak, explore, process, and grow.</blockquote>

<h2>Specialized Services</h2>

Specialized Services highlight a few of many different issues and populations I work with. For more information on other issues, diagnoses, and populations that I work with, please contact me.
<blockquote>
    
Relationships: Romantic relationships, familial relationships, friendships, and everything in between are a crucial part of our daily lives as humans. Without healthy relationships, we may find that our needs are not met, we do not have the support we feel we need, and we may feel unhappy. In therapy we can explore these relationships and discover a better and more fulfilling balance amongst these relationships for ourselves.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
    
Anxiety: Anxiety comes in all shapes and forms. When we struggle with anxiety, we may find ourselves  in fight or flight mode, 10 steps ahead in thought, and worrying more than those around us. Physically, we may feel queasy, dizzy, sweaty, like our heart is racing, and may fully avoid the things that are make us anxious. I am here to help you understand your anxiety better and work with, rather than against, your anxiety for better results.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
College Students: As a college student, you experience issues very specific to your population. Not only are you experiencing many transitions, but you are constantly under stress and pressure to perform and excel. It can be difficult to balance education, life transitions such as being away from home for the first time, and a social life. You may encounter struggles with your identity, with your emotions, and with the goals you have not yet accomplished. I am here to work beside you to process and work through all these changes.
